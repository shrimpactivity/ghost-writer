GhostWriter provides a simple browser interface for co-writing with public domain authors (aka *ghosts*). While writing, the app continuously provides text suggestion sourced from the selected author's work. 

This is **not** a ChatGPT / LLM frontend, but rather uses my custom markov-chain implementation [markov-coil](https://github.com/shrimpactivity/markov-coil).

Additional texts can be searched and downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), an online library of free e-books, using the [Gutendex API](https://gutendex.com/). Special thanks to them for greatly simplifying Gutenberg catalog access.
